    # A crew is a collection of tasks and agents that work together to achieve a common goal.
    
    # THE CREW HAVE SOME ATTRIBUTES WHICH ARE USED TO DETERMINE HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER
    # AGENTS,
    # TASKS,
    # PROCESS
    # THE FIRST TWO ARE COMPULSORY TO RUN THE CREW

# Accessing the crew output
# NOW THeSE ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE DIRECTLY FROM THE CREW INSTANCE
# BUT WE CAN ACCESS THEM FROM THE RESULT

# print(f"Raw Output: {crew_instance.raw}") #The raw output of the crew. This is the default format for the output.

#print(f"Tasks Output: {result.tasks_output}") #A list of TaskOutput objects, each representing the output of a task in the crew. 

#print(f"Token Usage: {result.token_usage}") # A summary of token usage, providing insights into the language modelâ€™s performance during execution.


# DIFFERENT WAYS TO KICKOFF A CREW
# 1. kickoff()
# 2. kickoff_for_each()      
# 3. kickoff_async()
# 4. kickoff_for_each_async()

# FOR MORE DETAILS OF THIS CHECK THE README FILE THANK YOU.  # noqa: E501

# the first one is written above

# Example of using kickoff_for_each
# inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
# results = crew_instance.kickoff_for_each(inputs=inputs_array)
# for result in results:
#     print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_async
# Make sure to run this in a async environment
# inputs = {'topic': 'FACE CREAM PRODUCT LAUNCH'}
# async def run_async_task():
#     async_result = await crew_instance.kickoff_async(inputs=inputs)
#     print(async_result)

# asyncio.run(run_async_task())

# # Example of using kickoff_for_each_async
# Make sure to run this in a async environment

# inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI EFFECT ON EDUCATION'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
# async def run_for_each_task():
#     async_results = await crew_instance.kickoff_for_each_async(inputs=inputs_array)
#     for async_result in async_results:
#         print(async_result)

# asyncio.run(run_for_each_task())
